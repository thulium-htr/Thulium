"""Language models for HTR decoding enhancement.

This module provides language models that can be integrated with CTC or
attention-based decoding to improve recognition accuracy by incorporating
linguistic knowledge.

Submodules:
    char_lm: Character-level LSTM and Transformer language models.
    word_lm: Word-level language models.
    ngram_lm: N-gram based language models.

Classes:
    CharacterLM: LSTM-based character language model.
    TransformerCharLM: Transformer-based character language model.
    LanguageModelScorer: Abstract interface for LM scoring.

Example:
    >>> from thulium.models.language_models import CharacterLM
    >>> lm = CharacterLM(vocab_size=100, hidden_size=256)
    >>> log_prob = lm.score([5, 10, 15, 20])
