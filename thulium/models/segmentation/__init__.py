"""Segmentation models for HTR preprocessing.

This module provides neural network models for text line and word segmentation,
which are essential preprocessing steps for handwriting text recognition.

Submodules:
    line_segmentation: Text line detection and extraction.
    word_segmentation: Word boundary detection.

Classes:
    LineSegmenter: U-Net based line segmentation model.
    WordSegmenter: Word boundary detection model.

Example:
    >>> from thulium.models.segmentation import LineSegmenter
    >>> segmenter = LineSegmenter(in_channels=3)
    >>> line_mask = segmenter(page_image)
