"""Recognition pipelines for Thulium HTR.

This module provides end-to-end recognition pipelines that combine
preprocessing, model inference, and postprocessing into unified workflows.
Pipelines abstract away the complexity of individual components, providing
a simple interface for text recognition.

Submodules:
    config: Pipeline configuration management.
    htr_pipeline: Main HTR pipeline implementation.
    segmentation_pipeline: Page layout analysis and line segmentation.
    form_pipeline: Structured form and table processing.
    multi_language_pipeline: Language-agnostic recognition.

Classes:
    HTRPipeline: Standard text-line recognition pipeline.

Example:
    Basic pipeline usage:

    >>> from thulium.pipeline import HTRPipeline
    >>> pipeline = HTRPipeline.from_pretrained("cnn_transformer_ctc_base")
    >>> result = pipeline.process(image, language="en")
    >>> print(result.full_text)
    'The quick brown fox'

    Custom configuration:

    >>> from thulium.pipeline import HTRPipeline
    >>> config = {"backbone": "resnet18", "decoder": "ctc"}
    >>> pipeline = HTRPipeline(config)
